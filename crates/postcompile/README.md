---

A crate which allows you to compile Rust code at runtime (hence the name `postcompile`).

What that means is that you can provide the input to `rustc` and then get back the expanded output, compiler errors, warnings, etc.

This is particularly useful when making snapshot tests of proc-macros, look below for an example with the `insta` crate.

## Usage

```rs
#[test]
fn some_cool_test() {
    insta::assert_snapshot!(postcompile::compile! {
        #![allow(unused)]

        #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
        struct Test {
            a: u32,
            b: i32,
        }

        const TEST: Test = Test { a: 1, b: 3 };
    });
}

#[test]
fn some_cool_test_extern() {
    insta::assert_snapshot!(postcompile::compile_str!(include_str!("some_file.rs")));
}
```

## Features

- Cached builds: This crate reuses the cargo build cache of the original crate so that only the contents of the macro are compiled & not any additional dependencies.
- Coverage: This crate works with [`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-llvm-cov) out of the box, which allows you to instrument the proc-macro expansion.

## Alternatives

- [`compiletest_rs`](https://crates.io/crates/compiletest_rs): This crate is used by the Rust compiler team to test the compiler itself. Not really useful for proc-macros.
- [`trybuild`](https://crates.io/crates/trybuild): This crate is an all-in-one solution for testing proc-macros, with built in snapshot testing.
- [`ui_test`](https://crates.io/crates/ui_test): Similar to `trybuild` with a slightly different API & used by the Rust compiler team to test the compiler itself.

### Differences

The other libraries are focused on testing & have built in test harnesses. This crate takes a step back and allows you to compile without a testing harness. This has the advantage of being more flexible, and allows you to use whatever testing framework you want.

In the examples above I showcase how to use this crate with the `insta` crate for snapshot testing.

## Status

This crate is currently under development and is not yet stable.

Unit tests are not yet fully implemented. Use at your own risk.

## Limitations

Please note that this crate does not work inside a running compiler process (inside a proc-macro) without hacky workarounds and complete build-cache invalidation.

This is because `cargo` holds a lock on the build directory and that if we were to compile inside a proc-macro we would recursively invoke the compiler.
