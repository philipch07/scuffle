---

A crate designed to provide a more user friendly interface to `tokio::signal`.

## Why do we need this?

The `tokio::signal` module provides a way for us to wait for a signal to be received in a non-blocking way.
This crate extends that with a more helpful interface allowing the ability to listen to multiple signals concurrently.

## Example

```rust
use scuffle_signal::SignalHandler;
use tokio::signal::unix::SignalKind;

let mut handler = SignalHandler::new()
    .with_signal(SignalKind::interrupt())
    .with_signal(SignalKind::terminate());

// Wait for a signal to be received
let signal = handler.await;

// Handle the signal
let user_defined1 = SignalKind::interrupt();
let terminate = SignalKind::terminate();
match signal {
    interrupt => {
        // Handle SIGINT
        println!("received SIGINT");
    },
    terminate => {
        // Handle SIGTERM
        println!("received SIGTERM");
    },
}
```
